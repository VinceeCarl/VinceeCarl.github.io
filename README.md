# **ERASERHEADS**
Ang Eraserheads ay isa sa mga tanyag na Pinoy alternative rock na banda sa Pilipinas noong kasikatan ng alternative rock noong unang bahagi ng dekada 1990. Tinuturing ang Eraserheads bilang ang banda na nagbukas ng pintuan upang magtagumpay ang ibang bandang Pilipino katulad ng Rivermaya, Parokya ni Edgar, at Yano. Tinatawag sila kadalasan ng kanilang mga tagahanga bilang "E-heads."

Eraserheads (sometimes stylized as ERASƎRHEADS or ƎRASƎRHƎADS) are a Filipino alternative rock band formed in 1989. With a line-up comprising Ely Buendia, Buddy Zabala, Marcus Adoro, and Raimund Marasigan, the band became the most influential and successful in the history of Filipino music. Often dubbed as "The Beatles of the Philippines", they have sold 9 million albums throughout their career[1][2] and are credited for spearheading a second wave of Manila band invasions,[3] paving the way for a host of Filipino alternative rock bands like Rivermaya.[4]The band released several singles, albums, and EPs. They achieved commercial success with their third album Cutterpillow (1995), which achieved platinum status several times. They also received the International Viewer's Choice Award (MTV Asia) at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards in New York, the only Filipino artist to have received the award before the conception of the MTV Asia Awards.

Naglabas din ang banda ng ilang awitin ("singles"), album at EP na umabot sa numero uno. Mas hayag ito sa paglabas ng ikatlo nilang istudyo album, ang Cutterpillow, na umabot sa estadong platinum ng makailang ulit. Ang Eraserheads ang isa sa pinakamatagumpay na musikero sa kasaysayan ng Pilipinas na nagbunsod sa kanila sa pandaigdigang entablado. Dahil dito, iginawad sa kanila ang Taong Buwan (Moon Man) sa MTV Video Music Awards.
Matagumpay ang pagbenta ng kanilang unang album sa isang pangunahing record label, ang Ultraelectromagneticpop, inilabas noong 1993 ng BMG Records. Inihatid ng album na ito ang underground "college rock" scene sa pampublikong kamalayan. Hinggil sa malaking impluwensiya at ambag nila sa musikang Pilipino ngayon, kadalasang tinatawag silang "The Beatles ng Pilipinas."Noong 1997, nanalo sila sa 1997 MTV Video Music Awards sa Lungsod ng New York, Estados Unidos at nagkamit ang awiting "Ang Huling El Bimbo" ng parangal bilang Asian Viewer's Choice Award noong nakaraang taon.
In July 1993, Eraserheads started recording their debut album called Ultraelectromagneticpop!.[7] The album featured "Pare Ko" (My Friend), "Toyang" and "Tindahan ni Aling Nena" (The Store of Aling Nena), all of which were also present in Pop-U!.[8] The album also featured a sanitized version of "Pare Ko" called "Walang Hiyang Pare Ko".[9] Later in the same year, BMG initially released 5,000 copies of the album. The album became a smash hit, with the songs "Ligaya", "Pare Ko" and "Toyang" topping the charts that, by the end of the year, BMG sold 300,000 copies, and Ultraelectromagneticpop! turned sextuple platinum.[3]

The album met some opposition as the Philippine Association of the Record Industry (PARI) attempted to censor "Pare Ko" but without success.[10] The public was said to have found its OPM Fab Four in Eraserheads, opening the second wave of band invasion,[3] dubbed "Eraserheadsmania".[11]

In October 1994, Eraserheads released a follow-up album entitled Circus.[7] The band said that the album aptly described their life since their debut. The album was unpredictable and unconventional compared to the OPM ballads at that time, and established the band members as songwriters and musicians. The songs varied in style and mood, ranging from euphoric and hilarious to tender and somber.[10] In the same year, Eraserheads played during the Miss Universe Pageant which was held in Manila.[12] On November 24, the band held their first major concert, titled "Eraserheads Jamboree", at the Folk Arts Theater (now the Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas) in Malate, Manila.[13]

Four of the songs became successive hits: "Kailan" (When), "Magasin" (Magazine), "Alapaap" (High Clouds) and "With a Smile".[14] Circus turned gold in just 30 days with 20,000 copies sold. Eventually, it turned quintuple platinum with 200,000 copies sold.[14] But like ultraelectromagneticpop!, it too had its share of controversy. In August 1995, Senator Tito Sotto, who was involved in an anti-drug campaign at that time, called for a ban on the airplay and sales of "Alapaap" over an alleged promotion of drug abuse in the lyrics of the song.[7][10] In response, Eraserheads denied the allegation, saying that it was just a misinterpretation, and that the song was the band's "ode to freedom", not an "ode to drug abuse".[15]

The group's third studio album Cutterpillow, was launched an open-air concert attended by fans and followers. With Christmas barely a month over, Eraserheads opened 1996 by making history in the Philippine music scene once more. Cutterpillow turned gold, even before it hit the record stores, as a result of the pre-selling promo campaign. Soon, the band shot the music video for the song "Ang Huling El Bimbo" (The Last El Bimbo) from the album.[11]

Later that year, the band came up with a conceptual Christmas album Fruitcake. The album is notable in that it is the first and only album of the band recorded entirely in English. This was shortly followed by a release of a companion storybook of the same title.[11]

The band that had crossed paths during their college days back in 1989 officially split up in the year 2002. After Eraserheads' main vocalist and songwriter Ely Buendia quit the band, it was confirmed that the famous 90’s band disbanded.
